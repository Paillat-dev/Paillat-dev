      <h3>Pythology</h3>
      <p>
        Pythology is a YouTube channel about Python. But it has a particularity: it is 99% automated. It uses a custom script to generate the videos, thumbnails, titles and descriptions thanks to multiple AI technologies and different APIs. The videos are then uploaded to YouTube automatically. The only needed manual work is to write make the video public on the YouTube Studio interface, because YouTube doesn't allow to do it with the API.
